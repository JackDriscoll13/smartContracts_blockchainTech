### Summary: 

This repo is contains work I've been doing to better understand blockchain technology. In my attempt
to learn more, I've begun developing my own smart contracts and deploying them to test networks. Using solidity 
in combination with python, I am able to retrieve real world data and utilize it in smart contracts, which exist 
on deterministic blockchain systems. 

This work is ongoing.
