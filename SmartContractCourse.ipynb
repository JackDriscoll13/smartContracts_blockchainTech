    "- Decentralized smart contracts exist on ethereum. <br>\n",
    "- Smart contracts allow for agreements without a third party intermediary. They are entirely written in code. <br>\n",
    "- The oracle problem. Smart contracts need to interact with real world data. Thats why we have hybrid smart contracts. Using oracle applications. <br>\n",
    "- Chainlink is an oracle application. Chainlink is the most popular oracle application.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:Green\">  Advantages to BlockChain: </span> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decentralized. No central entity to control financial markets, like bannks. <br>\n",
    "2. Transparency. Can see every interaction that occurs on public ledger <br>\n",
    "3. Speed. Allows for faster <br>\n",
    "4. Security and immutability. <br>\n",
    "5. Removal of counterparty Risk. Move away from political brand based agreement.  <br>\n",
    "6. Allow us to engage in trust minimized agreement. We don't have to trust other people to fufill our agreements. \"trustless\" <br>\n",

    "- Test applications on things not on the main net like rinkyby <br>\n",
    "- Using etherscan to view and analyze transactions <br>\n",
    "- Gas fees. You pay the miners/the block chain a fee. Gas x Gwei. <br>\n",
    "- Block space. Nodes can only put so many transactions into a block. They are incentivized by those who pay a higher fee (gas). <br> \n",

    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:Green\"> How it Works: </span> \n",
    "  \n",
    "- [BlockChain 101 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8)\n",
    "- [Visualising Blockchain Practice](https://www.andersbrownworth.com/blockchain)\n",
    "- Hash: a unique fixed length streng. Meant to identify a piece of data. Created by putting data into a hash function (algorithm)\n",
    "- The hash corresponds to the specific data in the block. ie, one block.\n",
    "- Nonce: the nonce is the solution to the block, the number where the specifc data matches the corresponding hash. \n",
    "- NONCE + DATA (tx) = unique hash\n",
    "- A node gets paid to \"mine\" or solve the block, by matching the nonce to the specific hash requirement (i.e. 4 zeros at the start of the hash) \n",
    "- Prev: points to the hash of the previous block\n",
    "- Changing one piece of data invalidates the entire block chain\n",
    "- Peer to peer: Each peer (node), each independent node has the same power, a mechanism of checks and balances for checking to make sure the blockchain is correct. Matching (hashes)\n",
    "- TX: transaction data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:Green\"> Public vs. Private Keys: </span>\n",
    "- Private Key > Public Key > Address \n",
    "- You sign your transactions using a private key. That key then generates a signature.\n",
    "- Anyone can verify that your signature is correct using your public key. Kinda confused about how exactly this all works but idk if it really matters \n",
    "- KEEP PRIVATE KEY PRIVATE AT ALL TIMES\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:Green\"> Consensus: </span>\n",
    "- Consesus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of the blockchain. \n",
    "- Consessus is composed of 1. Chain selection   2. Sybil Resistance \n",
    "    - Sybil Reistance: A blockchains defense against people creating multiple identies (nodes) to have more power over the system\n",
    "      - Proof of work (PoW): Mining - solving the complex problem. Very computationally expensive. chains can change the block time by changing difficulty of problem. \n",
    "        - Pros: Great sybil resistance. cons: energy expensive and enviormentally impactful\n",
    "      - Proof of Stake (PoS): Staking ... Nodes put up colleteral as evidence that they will \"behave\" on the block. miners replaced by validators. Validators are stakers that are chosen randomly\n",
    "      - to  solve a block and then validated by the rest of the nodes\n",
    "        - Pros: great sybil resistance mechanism, uses less energy. Cons: slightly less decentralized because of cost of stake\n",
    "    - Chain Selection Rule:\n",
    "      - In nakamoto consesus, the longest chain wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:Green\"> Types of Attacks That Can Happen: </span>\n",
    "- Sybil Attack: One user creates many nodes and uses lots of computational resources to gain unfair power. (less prevalent)\n",
    "- 51% attack: The longest chain is the correct one so long as it matches up with 51% of the rest of the network. (more prevalent) (someone )\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchains are democraticly driven. \n",
    "Blockchains are deterministic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:Green\"> Scalability: </span>\n",
    "- Current eth isnt scalable because gas prices ultimate put a fininacial constraint on how many people can be using the network\n",
    "- Eth 2.0 is hoping to solve this by transitioning to sharding. \n",
    "- Sharding is basically multiple networks 'sharding' off of the main network or block chain. Shards derive their security from the main layer but allow for less gas by existing on a slightly different plain.\n",
    "- Layer 1: base layer blockchain implementation \n",
    "- Layer 2: any application built on top of a layer 1. Rollups fall into this category"
